Contributing Music
==================

This game is intended to be a kind of "mix tape" of music-based bosses
that each use a song from a different artist. The bosses are bullet-hell
with an emphasis on synchronization, so patterns and transitions will be
dictated by the music.

I want to give you as much creative control as possible over genre, style,
instrumentation, mood, etc. You need to conform to some stylistic rules so
that it's possible to synchronize things, but you could do anything from
ambient to hardcore and it will fit.

The basic rules are:

 - 2-5 minutes long.
 - Tempo needs to have a whole number of frames between beats. Easiest way to do
that is to pick something divisible by 30, so a song with 90 or 120 bpm would
be fine, but if you want something more complicated you're free to do so.
 - Some kind of "event" every few seconds. The start of a distinctive phrase,
an instrument entering, a cymbal crash, stuff like that.
 - A series of larger events spaced through the piece. Verse-chorus boundaries,
shifts in the arrangement or texture, new themes entering, fermatas, stuff
like that.
 - A strong ending with a clearly delineated final note. You can have a
fade-out after that, but there has to be a moment where the song has come to a
solid conclusion.

If you do want a prompt, try to aim for hopeful, meditative, optimistic and
encouraging. Don't think of it as fight music, try thinking of it as the
music for a ritual, a sort of initiation. The bosses aren't your enemy, they
want to give you a challenge and push your limits as a player.

If you don't like that prompt, or have something completely different in mind,
do whatever you want.

The businessey stuff:

This is a free game. It has to be freely distributable, and it has to be
Twitch and YouTube friendly, so we'll need to negotiate an appropriately broad
license. My preference is for Creative Commons Attribution, but if there's
something you prefer we can discuss that.

The game is funded. If you want to be paid for this, we need to negotiate a
rate up front so that I'm not surprised farther down the line. If you do not
want to be paid, I'll need you to send me a message explicitly stating so.

Since this is mostly a solo operation, things move slowly. I stream the game's development on Twitch,
so you won't have to wonder whether or not the game is being worked on. I will
reply to messages within 48 hours, and let you know if I'm going on any
vacations that will prevent that.
