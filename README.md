## Gameplay

You control the blue insect. Your center is vulnerable, don't let the bullets
touch it. Spacebar will slow time and let you teleport out of trouble. Press
Shift to send out your spirit, which is invulnerable and can fill Spirit Wells.
You can only control one at a time, so make sure your body is safe before you
try to move your spirit.
