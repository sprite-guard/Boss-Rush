# Infinite Ritual
Bullet hell boss rush game developed live on Twitch.tv/spriteguard

>I made this game for a certain kind of person, to delight them.

This game can be run in Chrome or as a NWJS app. It has not been tested in any
other browsers, and probably doesn't work in them.

## Controls

* Arrow keys: move yourself
* Shift + arrows: move your spirit
* Space + arrows: slow time and teleport
* R: Restart current level
* A: jump to the test scene
* P: Pause
* I: Toggle invulnerability
* K: Skip current phase - only works on boss phases, crashes on final phase.
* escape: return to menu, or quit from menu (NWJS only)

## Gameplay

You control the blue insect. Your center is vulnerable, don't let the bullets
touch it. Spacebar will slow time and let you teleport out of trouble. Press
Shift to send out your spirit, which is invulnerable and can fill Spirit Wells.
You can only control one at a time, so make sure your body is safe before you
try to move your spirit.
