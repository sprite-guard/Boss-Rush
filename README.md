# Infinite Ritual
Bullet hell boss rush game developed live on Twitch.tv/spriteguard

This game currently only works on Chrome, and relies heavily on the ellipse
function, so it is unlikely to be ported to other browsers.

## Controls

* Arrow keys: move yourself
* Shift + arrows: move your spirit
* Space + arrows: slow time and teleport

## Gameplay

You control the black oval. Your center is vulerable, don't let the bullets
touch it. You can slow time and teleport if you get caught in a sticky situation.

Each ritual has a series of phases. Use your spirit to fill up the spirit wells
on each phase to progress to the next one. Your spirit is not affected by bullets.
